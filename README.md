# True-rms-meter-using-arduino
A True RMS (Root Mean Square) meter using Arduino is a project that measures the true RMS value of an AC voltage or current signal accurately, accounting for both sine and non-sine waveforms. 
It's vital for assessing power quality in electrical systems. The Arduino microcontroller samples the input signal, squares the values, calculates the mean, and then takes the square root to determine the RMS value. 
The Arduino's ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) is used for signal acquisition, and precise calculations are performed in code. A display, such as an LCD or LED display, can show the RMS voltage or current. 
This project is valuable for electronics enthusiasts and engineers working on power monitoring or control systems. It can also be extended for data logging or remote monitoring applications. 
Proper safety precautions should be taken when working with high-voltage circuits.
